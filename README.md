# Automate Price Tracking with this Python Script
This Python script is designed to track the price of a product on Amazon. It does so by sending a request to the Amazon website, using the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML, and extracting the product title and price. It then stores this information, along with the current date and time, in a CSV file.

The script is set up to run in a loop, with a delay of 1 second between each iteration. This means that the script will continuously check the price of the product and update the CSV file with the latest data.

This script could be useful for anyone interested in keeping track of the price of a product over time. It demonstrates how to use the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape data from a website, how to work with CSV files in Python, and how to use the time and datetime modules to manage time-based tasks.
